## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My Name is Shivam. I'm an IIT Kanpur-trained business analyst interested in optimizing all things using data.

- ðŸ”­ I will complete an MBA in Business Analytics at IIT Kanpur in April 2025, so I am looking for full-time opportunities post-April.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m working on [Emendo AI](https://emendo.ai/), building AI companion for renovation contractors.
- ðŸ‘¯ I recently built a power BI dashboard analyzing sales trends, customer preferences, and delivery efficiency of Blinkit, here(https://github.com/mshivam980/Blinkit-Data-Analysis-with-Power-BI).
- ðŸ¤” âš¡ Fun fact: I have 4 years of experience in product analytics, agile methodologies, and cross-functional collaboration.
